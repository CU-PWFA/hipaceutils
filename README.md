# HiPACE++ Utilities

This repository is where I store all decks, analysis scripts/notebooks, and examples I've gathered using HiPACE++. This includes example profiles, decks, and an example job script for the Great Lakes cluster at the University of Michigan.

The file structure is as follows:
```bash
.
├── analysis/			# Contains all resources related to data analysis
│   ├── notebooks/		# Interactive Jupyter Notebooks (walkthroughs, basic analysis, etc.)
│   └── scripts/		# Automation scripts for analysis tasks
├── decks/			# Collection of important and interesting input decks
├── jobex.sh		# Job batch script for running on the Great Lakes cluster at the University of Michigan
├── profile.hipace	# Environment setup file for HiPACE++ on the Great Lakes cluster
└── README.md		# Overview of the project, usage instructions, and documentation
```
